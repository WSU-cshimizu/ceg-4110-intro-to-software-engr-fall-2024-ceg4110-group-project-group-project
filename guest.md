About the Development Cycle, they talked about Scrum  & Kanban: 
  - Scrum has 2 week sprint cycles where you plan before, then do the work, then plan again. There might be too many things that interrupt the cycle, that's not good depending on your tasks that might be time sensitive
  - Kanban is working on a single item until it is completed, then you start the next item. The problem is that you might want to fix bugs or test which might hinder overall progress
  - Most companies like using a mix. They use Trello, Azure Devops and Jira 
  - Sometimes there's a market condition like another company goes out of business and their assets need to be picked up by other companies. 
  - They write user stories with stakeholders before they deliver those to developers
