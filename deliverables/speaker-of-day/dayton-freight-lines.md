## Lessons Learned

- Dilean:
    - I learned about the importance of a Business Analyst, how they are the key to connect a developer to the stakeholders. My original assumption was that a team lead would usually be the one in charge of translating companies needs to software developing tasks. 
- Aziz:
    - I learned the importance of communication between team members and different departments when it comes to prioritizing task.
- Jinho: 
    - I learned that it is important to work within the structure as a group. This is not only confined to communicate clearly between business team and development team, but also between company and customer.
- Revanth:
    - I found it interesting that Dayton Freight Lines switched from Scrum to Kanban due to frequent disruptions in their service industry. Kanban allows them to handle tasks more flexibly and prioritize urgent issues. This shows how agile methods can be adapted based on business needs.
- David:
    - I learned that the most important resource to getting a job is networking and making yourself presentable. Most importantly I learned that I should always be carrying some copies of my resume with me incase there is an opportunity to share a copy with a potential employer. 

## 2 Things that are different from Cogan

1. User Story
- Tim said that each company has different meanings of "User Story" and he defines his user story as a minimal piece of work that can be pushed to production without extra preparation. However, during the class we learned that a user story is a want a user wants and why. During both our lecture and Tim's presentation the definitions were similar, but differed in the fact that DFL puts some restrictions on what a user story can demand.

2. Scrum vs Kanban 
- We learned about the difference between Kanban and Scrum. While Scrum is focused on doing sprint and getting a set amount of goals  before the end of the spring, Kanban is more focused on getting a single feature all the way in the production line. We learned that scrum is not very beneficial as a service company since many issues interrupt the sprint milestones and make developers take more time planning sprints than developing, while the Kanban methodology allows for issues to be pushed through the whole process to completion without disrupting the flow of development.
