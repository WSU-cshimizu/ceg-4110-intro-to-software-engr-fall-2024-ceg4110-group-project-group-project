## Lessons Learned
- Dilean:
    - I found interesting the way that the company measures success, compared to riverside research (which is how much impact they have on the people), these people instead use burndown charts, backlog depths, developer stories and points and many more. I also found interesting that they outsource their ideas if they are not financially viable. 
- Aziz:
    - I learned that the pitfalls of agile in a company could be caused by lack of communication, lack of planning, or business process change

- Jinho: 
    - I learned that saving cost is the most important decision point in the perspective of business.
    Outsourcing third-party software can make cost-management out of control, so Winsupply tries to avoid vendor lock in.
    This was also mentioned in Riverside-Research, and it be one of the important decision points in business.

 - Revanth:
    - I learned that Winsupply commitment to innovation and operational excellence is evident in how they manage large-scale projects globally. Their ability to balance technology design, data strategy, and business processes reflects a deep understanding of both areas. By prioritizing cloud-first strategies, mobile apps, and AI, they stay ahead of industry trends while remaining adaptable through agile methods.
- David:
    - I learned that the most common problem Winsupply has with the Agile methodology is that there can generally be a lack of planning before the software development begins. This can cause unnecessary extra funding and time from having to try multiple solutions.
    
## Pertinent Questions
Q1: Why haven't they changed from Angular?

    Changing js frameworks veery often is not ideal because guidelines and style guides will need to be changed much often while sticking with a technology for the long run provides much more stability. 

Q2: Does it ever become more cost effective to outsource software instead of making your own software?

    Yes it doe because when creating software we want a 163% return on the product we make.
