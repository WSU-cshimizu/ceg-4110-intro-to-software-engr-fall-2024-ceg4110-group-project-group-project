# Speaker of the Day: Riverside Research

## Lessons Learned
- Dilean:
    - I learned that companies with such a fast pace environment opt to do short sprints of a day, which allows for very fast development but low quality products.  
- Aziz:
    - I learned that companies would rather build on top of their old software and my just purchase license for software instead of having their team build it from sratch
- Jinho: 
    - I learned that user-stories are important in that his team spends a lot of time on feedback as much as on coding. This is also the key feature of agile, which is consistently checking if we're doing well on meeting customer's requirement.
- Revanth:
    - What I find most inspiring about Riverside Research is their dedication to delivering innovative solutions through collaborative efforts and a design-thinking approach. Their focus on rapid prototyping and agile development enables them to remain highly adaptable and responsive to customer feedback. This ensures they consistently produce effective, high-value solutions that address real-world challenges.
- David:
    - I learned from this presentation that getting user input very frequently allows a product to be created right the first time rather than having to do multiple development cycles and wasting time. Having the user attend developer reflection meetings and frequently getting updates on the product is priceless for both parties.
