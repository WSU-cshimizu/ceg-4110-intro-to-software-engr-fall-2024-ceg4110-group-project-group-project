# Software Development Plan

## Administrative


### Communication
* Meeting Location: Discord
* Meeting Times:    Tuesdays & Fridays asynchronously
* Communication Plan:  
  
In order to accomidate member work and class commitments, meetings shall be held via Discord chat on Tuesdays and Fridays. Each member will post updates on their specific deliverables as well as any other questions for the group. Each member commits to posting responding by the end of said days. Other meetings may be scheduled as necessary, either in-person or in Discord. Team members will touch base during Tuesday and Thursday class time, as well as having the Discord chat available at all times for questions.   
  
### Project Development
* We are implementing Agile game development in the form of sprints
* Each sprint, specific features of the game will be assigned to each member
* Sprints will generally be two weeks long
* During the twice weekly meeting, team members will update on their sprint progress
* Any assistance or questions by team members may be posted in the team Discord chat at any time
* After each sprint the team shall discuss the progress of the project and decide on the nexts sprints goals/features
  
This project development plan will enable the team to adjust to the many issues that will surely come up during development of a complex project such as this game. With short, two-week sprints, any features that are not coming together can be pivote in a different direction. Each team member will also know exactly which components/features of the project they are responsible for each sprint cycle.
