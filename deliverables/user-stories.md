# Project C.H.I.M.E.R.A.
---
## Overview:
The goal of C.H.I.M.E.R.A. is to compile all known supernatural entity data and compare reports from students to help determine unknown supernatural entities at Wright State.
### User-Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to submit reports of my paranormal experience, so that I can share my experience and contribute towards the investigation.

- As a user, I want to be able to see reports of other people's entity sightings, so that I can stay informed about what's going on.

- As a user, I want to be able to view a dictionary of all known entities, so that I can learn more about them and compare my experiences.

- As a user, I want to be able to see possible entities that match my report, to better understand what I've experienced.

- As an admin user, I want to have special access to manage user reports, so that I ensure accurate and relevant information. 

### Developer stories

- As a backend developer of comparative analysis tools, I would like to be able to see the relationships between our different entities, reports, and locations so I can correlate the acquired data.

- As a frontend developer, I want to understand the types of information that we need, so that I can gather that data from the user.

- As a backend developer, I want to be able to interface with the database and frontend, so that data can flow back and forth between them.

- As a database designer, I want to understand the data that we're interested in collecting, so that I can determine data types and create a schema.

- As a frontend developer of the admin portal, I want to be able to interface with the backend, so that I can access the data to display to the admin user.

### Equipment:

- A machine for each developer to be able to contribute
- Any device that can access websites (i.e. Laptop, PC, etc.)
