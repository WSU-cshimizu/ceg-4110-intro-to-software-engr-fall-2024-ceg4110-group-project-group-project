## Overview:
The goal of C.H.I.M.E.R.A. is to compile all known supernatural entity data and compare reports from students to help determine unknown supernatural entities.
### User-Stories

- As a user I should be able to submit reports of my paranormal experience.

- As a user I should be able to see reports of other people's entity sightings.

- As a admin user I should be able to view all entity sightings and delete or edit reports. 

- As a user I should be able to view a dictionary of all known entities.

- As a user I should be able to see possible entities that match my report.

### Developer stories
