## Lessons Learned

whenever the customer is asking for a specific requirement 
of the software, the software team should look over it thoroughly and 
analyze various factors that can benefit all the users and satisfy 
customer.

As a software developer we need to provide the timelines under which we 
can do our job apprropriately and concisely. Not pushing the timeline 
earlier and do not meet the requirements.

Using agile methodologies is the best way to approach as a software 
developers.
