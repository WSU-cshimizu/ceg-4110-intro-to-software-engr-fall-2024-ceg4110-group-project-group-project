# Software Development Plan

### Communication Plan
* As of now, we've only agreed to meet in discord voice chat.
* We will meet Tuesday nights, sometime after 9.
* This will be once a week for sure, more if we deem necessary.

* We will be communicating completely through discord if not in person.

We anticipate communicating via discord outside of meetings. We have committed to responding by the end of the day of any day that we agree to get work done. We will also do updates twice a week, once at the beginning and once at the end.
