# Software Development Plan

## Communication Plan

All group members are available to meet after 6 PM on weekdays as needed and are present during class sessions, where we can discuss ideas and collaborate on the progress of our project effectively.

### Meeting Location(s)

We have decided to establish two different meeting locations for in-person collaboration and use Discord for remote meetings:

- Fawcett Hall 204 (After class): Thhis location is conveniently located near our classroom, allowing us to easily transition from class to project work. It is ideal for casual discussions and quick updates when class is dismissed early. This allows us to use post-class time efficiently and reduces disruptions to team members' schedules.
- Library Annex 025 (Help Desk Lounge): This location is chosen for focused meetings and critical decision-making tasks, such as coding, debugging, or hands-on activities. The space provides a quieter, tech-equipped environment that facilitates deeper collaboration on key project milestones. It’s an ideal space for group activities that require attention and the use of shared technical resources.

### Meeting Time(s)

- Fawcett Hall :
  If our class is dismissed early, we will use the remaining time to discuss project updates and progress. If class runs its full length, we will hold a virtual meeting on Discord from 6:30 PM to 7:30 PM on Tuesdays and Thursdays to ensure we stay on track. This schedule accommodates all members' availability and offers a balance between in-person and remote work.
- Library Annex 025 :
  For critical decision-making and hands-on activities, we will meet in person at the Library Annex (Room 025). These meetings will be scheduled in advance and reserved for key project milestones or tasks that require group collaboration. The location provides access to essential resources and tools needed for in-depth project work.

### Meeting Cadence

#### Weekly Meetings :

We will meet three times a week (two virtual and one in-person as needed) to ensure consistent progress and effective collaboration. The virtual meetings on Discord are scheduled after class to allow flexibility and ensure that all members can attend.

#### Ad-hoc Meetings :

We will call an ad-hoc meeting as needed for specific issues or in the case of a major discovery, with at least 24 hours’ notice. This provides the flexibility to address any urgent or unforeseen challenges in the project.

### Communication mechanism (s) for outside of meeting

For communication outside of meetings, we will use Discord to coordinate and discuss any project updates or questions.
Also, team members are expected to respond to discord messages within 2 hours during weekday evenings. (6PM – 10PM). This ensures efficient communication and decision-making when not in meetings.

## Timeline

### MVSs

- Date: End of week 4 (09/22/24)
- Description: Finalize the analysis and specifications for the project, defining the scope that will deliver the minimum viable product (MVP).

### Requirement Specification

- Date: End of week 5 (09/29/24)
- Description - This document will detail the specific functional and non-functional requirements of the C.H.I.M.E.R.A. system. It will define how data should be collected, stored, and processed, as well as the necessary algorithms for comparing student reports to known supernatural entities. This stage will ensure all technical and user-based needs are clearly outlined for development.

### Design Specification

- Date: End of week 6 (10/06/24)
- Description : The design specification will provide a detailed blueprint for how the C.H.I.M.E.R.A. system will be built. It will include database schema designs for storing supernatural entity data, the user interface design for report submission, and the architecture of the comparison system. The document will also cover the interactions between various components, ensuring the system's overall functionality.

### Milestones (i.e., "Checkins")

Milestone 1: Requirements and Design Completion

- Date: End of week 6 (10/06/24)
- Description: This milestone marks the completion of the planning phase for the C.H.I.M.E.R.A. system. All requirements and design documents, including the detailed specifications for how the system will function, will be finalized and uploaded. The documents will outline the necessary features, database structure, and overall architecture, ensuring a clear roadmap for development.

Milestone 2: Core Functionality Implemented

- Date: End of Week 10 (11/01/24)
- Description: This milestone focuses on the initial implementation of C.H.I.M.E.R.A.’s core functionalities. The backend APIs, which will handle data collection and comparisons of supernatural reports, will be developed. Additionally, a basic front-end interface will be set up, allowing users to start interacting with the system.

Milestone 3: Integration and Testing

- Date: End of Week 12 (11/17/24)
- Description: By this milestone, all components of the C.H.I.M.E.R.A. system will be fully integrated, including the backend, front-end, and database. Comprehensive testing will begin, with a focus on identifying and fixing bugs, ensuring the system functions as expected across different scenarios and user inputs.

Milestone 4: Final MVP Version

- Date: End of Week 12 (11/17/24)
- Description: This milestone represents the delivery of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for C.H.I.M.E.R.A. The core features will be fully implemented, integrated, and tested, providing a working system that can collect, analyze, and compare supernatural reports. This version will be functional and ready for further refinement or expansion based on feedback.
