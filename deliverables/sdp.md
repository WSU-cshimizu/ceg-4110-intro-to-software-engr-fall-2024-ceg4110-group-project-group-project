# Software Development Plan

### Communication Plan

- Meeting Location: Online on Discord
- Meeting Time: 12:00PM - 1:30PM
- Meeting Cadence: Saturday and Sunday

- Communication mechanism(s) for outside of meetings: Discord

We anticipate communicating via Discord outside of meetings. We have committed to responding within `1hr` timeframe.

This is because we did not manage to find a good in-person meeting time during the weekday, but we plan on generally being accessable to each other outside the meeting time via Discord.

### Project Management

How to make decisions: Whenever someone comes across an issue, we will discuss it amongst ourselves.

This decision was made because nobody wanted to be "in charge".
