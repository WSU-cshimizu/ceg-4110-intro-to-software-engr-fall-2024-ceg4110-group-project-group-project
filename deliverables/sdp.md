## CP(Critical Path):

The critical path was designed based on the sequential steps essential to 
the completion of the online voting system project. We've ensured that 
tasks related to core system functionality, such as user authentication, 
ballot creation, and voting tally mechanisms, are prioritized first. These 
components are critical since any delay in their completion would directly 
affect subsequent tasks, like user interface adjustments and system 
security enhancements. Given our team's consistent workflow and effective 
collaboration, we're confident in adhering to this path with minimal risk 
of delays.

## PM(Project Management):

For project management, we employed a risk-averse approach, taking into 
account possible delays or challenges with resource availability and team 
member workloads. The project timelines were built to accommodate 
flexibility, allowing us to adapt if certain tasks take longer than 
anticipated. By frequently reviewing progress through team check-ins and 
refining our Gantt chart as needed, we aim to maintain focus on key 
deliverables while ensuring that the team can address unforeseen issues 
without affecting overall project deadlines.
