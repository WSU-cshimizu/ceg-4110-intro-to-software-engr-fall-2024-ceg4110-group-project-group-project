# Software Development Plan

### Communication Plan
* As of now, we've only agreed to meet in discord voice chat.
* We will meet on Thursday at 4pm.
* This will be once a week for sure, more if we deem necessary.

* We will be communicating completely through discord if not in person.

We anticipate communicating via discord outside of meetings. We shall have asynchronous meetings to support member work and class schedules. We shall post updates and questions Tuesdays and Fridays on Discord. Each member commits to posting their updates and responding to questions by the end of the day on these meeting days.
