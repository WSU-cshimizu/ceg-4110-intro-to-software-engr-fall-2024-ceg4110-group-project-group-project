# Software Development Plan


<<<<<<< HEAD
## Communication Plan
  All group members are available to meet after 6 PM on weekdays as needed and are present during class sessions, where we can discuss ideas and collaborate on the progress of our project effectively.
### Meeting Location(s)
  We have decided to establish two different meeting locations for in-person collaboration and use Discord for remote meetings:
   - Fawcett Hall 204 (After class)
   - Library Annex 025 (Help Desk Lounge)

### Meeting Time(s)
  - Fawcett Hall
    If our class is dismissed early, we will use the remaining time to discuss project updates and progress. If class runs its full length, we will hold a virtual meeting on Discord from 6:30 PM to 7:30 PM on Tuesdays and Thursdays to ensure we stay on track.
  - Library Annex 025 
    For critical decision-making and hands-on activities, we will meet in person at the Library Annex (Room 025). These meetings will be scheduled in advance and reserved for key project milestones or tasks that require group collaboration.  

### Meeting Cadence
  - Weekly Meeting
   We will meet three times a week to ensure consistent progress.
  - Ad-hoc Meetings
   We will call an ad-hoc meeting as needed for specific issues or in the case of a major discovery, with at least 24 hours’ notice.   

### Communication mechanism (s) for outside of meeting
  For communication outside of meetings, we will use Discord to coordinate and discuss any project updates or questions.
  Also, team members are expected to respond to discord messages within 2 hours during weekdays. (8 AM – 9 PM).
