# Group Retrospective

## What went well in the group... 

* Team members consistently supported one another, sharing knowledge and resources to overcome challenges. 
* All team members consistently participated in our weekly meetings. 
* We divided the work equally based on each member's skills. 

## What could have been better in the group... 

* Sometimes, tasks were started later than planned. 
* At the beginning, there were some communication gaps. 
* We could have set stricter deadlines for ourselves. 

## What went well in the class... 

* Thursday meetings were flexible, and the class gave practical project experience. 
* The guest speakers were engaging and provided valuable insights that will be helpful in the future. 
* The TA was responsive, and clear guidelines made things easier. 

## What could have been better in the class... 

* Although the class had first and final drafts as milestones, more frequent reviews or check-ins by professors could provide specific feedback and better guidance, ensuring projects stay on track and meet expectations. 

## Further comments 
* Overall, our group really enjoyed developing this project with all the freedom and guidance from the professor and TA.
