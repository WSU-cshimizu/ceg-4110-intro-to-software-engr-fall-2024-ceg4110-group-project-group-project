## Lessons Learned

Determining priority order for managing work done by looking at production time and impact of a feature in determining what gets worked on first. You can quantify most things to help visualize the impact of a feature on the user. For example, the amount of time wasted by the user because of the lack of a feature or placement of one.

Priority of things can vary depending on each person and sometimes people think their problem is more important than others, so talking it over with the group will help decide the next steps for the problem.

If a reason is provided, a "why" per se, for a requirement/feature, it is often easier for developers to figure out the little things that might go wrong or might slip through QA that others might miss.
