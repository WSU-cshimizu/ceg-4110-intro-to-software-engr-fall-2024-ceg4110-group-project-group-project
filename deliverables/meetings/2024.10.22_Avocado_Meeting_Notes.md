- Design Pattern description State Design Pattern:
    1. Shows the validation process when an instance of an expense object is created. Default is to define expense object variable valid as true.
    2. Checks if arguments passed are valid (correct type and within bounds if applicable).If they are not valid, then changes the expense object status for valid as false.
    3. This method handles database entry errors that would mess up the database. This status is used to handle errors and route the user to the proper screen and process depending on the state of the expense object.
