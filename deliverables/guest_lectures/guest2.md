## Pertinent Questions
- ***Question 1*** If you deal with goverment, what type of data do you see for prototyping, is anything restricted, and do you need security clearance to use it?
- ***Question 2*** On average how long are their projects? 2 day to 2 week or longer? Are you updating curent database and applications to a more modern efficient program vs building inputs, outputs, features from scratch.
-  ***Question 3*** When was the last punchcard, cassete, or floppy disk that you saw in a system process?


## Lessons Learned
- Todd mentioned O1 for chatgpt, his team uses it a lot for prototyping. It seems that their team relies on it heavily.
- Great for non developers, add unit tests, add commenting, port to a different language, chatgpt used a lot if needed.
- Warning on using github - if you build it there - Microsoft owns it and can use it.
- Careful with what tools you use, could pass over writes to your code.
- Civilians vs Military for DOD
- They ask for something, then want something else, after three months of changes, what user is using this?
- Identify user, identify problem, who is going to use it? They seem very user focused which was a difference from Dayton Freight Lines.
- For goverment contracts, time is a huge factor, they want fast results that are reliable and solve the issue.
- They have 2 days to two week deliveries.
- Prefer user stories over system requirements.
- Product blitz, five day activity to develop a product.
- Build stories, tie to epics, define after Friday, then build the product out.
- Then define architecture, responsiblities, technologies, talk to team define who is doing what.
- Sprint come back, review, retrospect how to improve.
- Portals to databases - lots of front end
- They spend half their time with the customer, the other half the time developing.
- Todd really likes user stories vs requirements 


## Differences
- Their process Design Thinking, Rapid Prototyping, Agile Development, Sustainment (Problem Solving, Execution & Solution, Deliver Value). Customer Problem to Customer Solution. 
- They talk about outcomes - (I want statements) that is the start of their process.
- They even focus on sustainment, making sure it is used after the fact.
- Agile is an adjective - working software over documentation,
