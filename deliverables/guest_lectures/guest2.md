## Pertinent Questions
- ***Question 1*** If you deal with goverment, what type of data do you see for prototyping, is anything restricted, and do you need security clearance to use it?
- ***Question 2*** 


## Lessons Learned
- Todd mentioned O1 for chatgpt, his team uses it a lot for prototyping. It seems that their team relies on it heavily.
- Great for non developers, add unit tests, add commenting, port to a different language, chatgpt used a lot if needed.
- Warning on using github - if you build it there - Microsoft owns it and can use it.
- Careful with what tools you use, could pass over writes to your code.
- Civilians vs Military for DOD
- They ask for something, then want something else, after three months of changes, what user is using this?
- Identify user, identify problem, who is going to use it? They seem very user focused which was a difference from Dayton Freight Lines.

## Differences
- Their process Design Thinking, Rapid Prototyping, Agile Development, Sustainment (Problem Solving, Execution & Solution, Deliver Value). Customer Problem to Customer Solution. 
- They talk about outcomes - (I want statements) that is the start of their process.
