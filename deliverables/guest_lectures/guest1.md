## Pertinent Questions
### Question 1 We asked about how to decide what kind of equipment to use. Their response was detailed, the biggest decision they made was on longevity and expected long term support.
### Question 2 we asked about their frequency of interaction with their end-user. Their response led us to believe that their user stories are driven more from a corporate level than from the perspective of the trucker / end user.


## Lessons Learned

We learned that agile is very broad in topic, essentially it is required to be more flexible than the waterfall method. The broadness can be benificial to tailor the methodology to your business needs, but can often require better organization and communication. It seems that agile allows for more failure and work on the fly, which might lead to burnout if not properly managed. Often good communication and mention of missing features as a result of a tight deadline can change the opinion on what the timeline should be. 

## Differences
1. I believe that we had not heard about kanban before as an agile concept. They talked about flowing one story all the way through
2. It seems that the user stories were corporate suite driven. Rather than a user focused environment.
