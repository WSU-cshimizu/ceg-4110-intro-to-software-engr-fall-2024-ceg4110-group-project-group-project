## Pertinent Questions
* Todd mentioned that the team deals with a lot of sustainment burden as they have to sustain all of their different products many of 
which using different software and such. How do you balance the amount of time you spend on maintinence without taking away from your 
development time on new projects?
* Todd brought up developer pride with things like not using AI tools and instead prefering to do things by hand and keeping their skills sharp. Does developer pride tend to cause any ineffeciencies or make things unnessarily more difficult?

## Lessons Learned
Outcomes are generally more important than solutions. Everyone wants to implement their own solution using their own software stack, 
but as long as everyone is clear on what the outcome should be, the specific solution used to get there does not matter too much.

Agile was never meant to be a noun, it was meant as an adjective, and it was intended to empower the developers. It allows them to have 
a voice in whats going on and allows them to "control the how".

You should spend about the same amount of time recieving feedback as you do developing the product. That is a good middle ground to 
keep everyone on the same page with what they need to do without getting people too involved.

## Differences in Teaching
Minimum Usable Product is more accurate than minimum viable product. The most basic version of your product that people would still use.

After gathering requirements, rapid prototyping is conducted before transitioning to Agile development.
