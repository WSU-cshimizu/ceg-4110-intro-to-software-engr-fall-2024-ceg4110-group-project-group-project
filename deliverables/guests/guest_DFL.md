## Pertinent Questions
How do you assess someone's skill set during an interview, especially when hiring based on skills rather than open positions?

Many people consider their problems to be the highest priority. How do you show them that there are more important issues?

## Lessons Learned
Agile can be useful even for companies not typically associated with software engineering. We learned how useful Agile practices, especially with their switch from Scrum to Kanban, and how they have improved their work operationally.

When assessing priority, it is possible to quantify things usually thought of as unquantifiable by thinking of the problem from a different perspective. Tim gave the example of comparing how much time a user is losing and how much time an engineer would need to fix the problem.

Often times, there is difference between what stakeholders think they know what they want in a software system and what really is needed in a software. To bridge this gap, the business analyst sits through multiple iterations of discussions with stakeholders and guide them towards what really is necessary for the project success.

## Differences in Teaching
Scrum struggles with unexpected events occuring during a sprint that's already planned out.
