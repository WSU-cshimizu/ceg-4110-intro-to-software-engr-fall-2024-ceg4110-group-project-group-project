## Pertinent Questions
* Question 1 - With over 200 software development projects going on at once and with a 1.5 year roadmap, how often do issues come up that push back the length of the roadmap by a significant margin?

* Question 2 - If there is a software development team that is having poor performance, do you try and push them to change their development framework?

## Lessons Learned

* Winsupply is the second largest company in Dayton Ohio

* Second largest plumbing wholesaler in the entire U.S.

* Winsupply wants a baseline 163% return on projects

## Teaching Differences
* Depending on the type of team and the type of project, different software development methodology might work way better than another

* Chris encourages developers, organizations to adapt to trends as even till this date, people dont want to change their working systems/workflow just because its comfortable.
