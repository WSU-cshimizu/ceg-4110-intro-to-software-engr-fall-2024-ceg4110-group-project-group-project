## Pertinent Questions
* Question 1 - How long did it take you to find your first job?
* Question 2 - Have you completely left the software engineering scene? Or if the right job opportunity came up, would you take it?

## Lessons Learned

* Survivorship bias (Dont look at the broken parts, look at the parts that survived and returned)
* Found a vulnerability within pilot allowing emails to be spoofed
* Most of the time, you need to apologize often... (Sorry for the bad weather, also I broke production)
## Teaching Differences
* Expand your knowledge to the size of your aquarium (Dayton vs. Coasts)
* Not explaining everything inside the software engineering career. Explaining how software engineering is as a whole and how hard obtaining and maintaining a job is.
