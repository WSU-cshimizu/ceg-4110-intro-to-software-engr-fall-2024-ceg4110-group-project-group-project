# Figuring It Out - Project Overview Proposal

## Project Name
###### Recreation Center Equipment Management System (RCEMS)

## Elevator Pitch
Recreation Center Equipment Management System (RCEMS) will allow users to book and manage recreational equipment online. Users will be asked to register and then be able to check availability and book items like bicycles and footballs online, while the system ensures real-time updates and reduces wait times. The administrators can easily track bookings and handle reports of damage. With our focus on convenience and efficiency, RCEMS will improve the overall experience for both users and administrators. 

## Components of Complexity
1. Backend: Store data like equipment availability, damage reports, and user activity.
2. Website: Serve as the primary interface for students to interact with the system, view available equipment, book items, and report damage.
3. User Authentication (Student and Admin Login): Implement user roles with access restrictions. Features for students to track booking history. Admin panel for managing equipment and handling bookings.
4. Equipment Booking System: Display Real-time availability for all equipment offered. Equipment reservation and management of the booking lifecycle, if it is available, when to return.
5. Breakage/Damage Reporting: Students can report damage or malfunction of equipment. Administrators can see the equipment status and update based on the report.
