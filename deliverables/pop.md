# Project Overview Proposal

## Requirements
* Name of the proposed project: Matthew's Journey
* Elevator pitch, which should at least answer
  * "Why are you building your _thing_?" For FUN
* _N_ "things of complexity", where _N_ is number of students in the group.
  * Describe each component, briefly. -- 4 things of complexity
     * Real Time combat mixed with turn-based mechanics
     * Pixellated art
     * Storyline
     * Map and GUI design
* How do the components fit together (i.e., predicted architecture)?
    * Prompt: "We think, based on not touching it yet, we'll do..."
    * A Legend of Zelda like game, 2D pixel art with combat throughout the journey and a boss at the end.
* What language or technology stack or framework will be used?
    * Include a response to: "why are you picking the tech stack that you are?"
       * We will be picking libGDX, a Java-based game engine, along with Java GUI libraries
