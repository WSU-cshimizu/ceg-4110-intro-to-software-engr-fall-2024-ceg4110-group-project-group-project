# Name of Project - Raider Social


## Elevator Pitch
- Raider Social will be a way for Wright State students to connect and communinicate with each other. Raider Social will be exclusive to just Wright State students.

## N things of complexity (componets)
- UI Design
  - Creating a appealing and user friendly interface
- Backend
  - Writing the business logic and communicating with the database
- Data Storage
  - Persistent storage for user and app data
- Deployment
  - Deploying to GoDaddy
- Testing
  - Testing the whole system to ensure functionality 
  
## What language or technology stack or framework will be used (Why as well)?

- Flutter (Dart)
  - We will be using Flutter as a framework and Dart programming language to create Mobile Application for the UI portion of the system. We have chosen Flutter because it is cross platform framework and will allow us to create both iOS and Andriod application at the same time. Since the time constraints and developers of this project is limited, we have have choosen Flutter to better use our time and team members more efficiently.

- Express
  We will be using Express framework and Javascript programming language to create the Server of our system. We have selected Express framework to create the server of our system because the developer community of Express is extremely huge and it the most widely used framework for backend developement in this day and age. Due to its mass adoption we are hopeful that any hinderances that we might face during the developement process will be quickly and easily resolved.

- PostgreSQL
  We are opting to use PostgreSQL as our datebase of choise. PostgreSQL is also a widely used RDBMS and will give us the oppertunity to work with and learn SQL language whilst we create the database of of our system.

- GoDaddy
  We will use GoDaddy to host our Server. GoDaddy is free to use and is relatively less complex compared to other alternatives such as AWS. Hosting in GoDaddt is realatively and easier process and since none of our team memners are well versed in deployment of Servers we are using GoDaddy as a safe bet for now.
