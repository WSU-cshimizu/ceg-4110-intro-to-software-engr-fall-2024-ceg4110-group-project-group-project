# Testing plan
## Front-end (Revanth)
### Frontend Test plan

Test Plan: Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Our frontend testing plan for the fitness app will follow TDD principles, ensuring functionality and performance by
 writing tests before code. The focus will be on unit, integration, and snapshot tests to verify components and their interactions.

### Testing Framework: Jest

We’ve chosen Jest for its simplicity and strong support in React projects. It provides a full testing environment for unit,
 snapshot, and mocked tests. React Testing Library (RTL) complements Jest by focusing on user interactions, ensuring that the
  app behaves as expected from a user’s perspective.

### Justification for testing plan

The chosen testing plan fits well into the team's Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, which is a key part of the overall
 software development strategy for the fitness app. Here's why it aligns effectively:

Consistency with TDD Approach:
The plan's emphasis on writing tests before the implementation ensures that development is driven by clear requirements and
 expected behavior. This aligns perfectly with the team's TDD process, as it allows developers to focus on the exact features 
 
 needed for each user and developer story, providing clear goals for implementation.

Integration with Backend Testing Plan:
The team is already using pytest for backend testing, and this frontend testing plan complements that by providing robust checks 
for the UI. This ensures a cohesive testing strategy across both frontend and backend systems, where each part of the application 
is validated against its respective user stories.

Mock API Testing:
By mocking API responses in the frontend tests, the team can simulate backend interactions without waiting for live data. This ensures
 that frontend developers are not blocked by backend delays and can test how the UI responds
 
### Framework justification
Framework Choice Justification:
The choice of React Testing Library (RTL) with Jest is highly achievable and adequate for testing the frontend.
 RTL focuses on testing the app from the user's perspective, ensuring the components behave as expected. 
 Jest's fast and integrated setup within React projects simplifies the process, reducing overhead. 
 The combination supports both unit and integration testing, allowing the team to simulate various user interactions. 
 With a strong ecosystem and documentation, the team can easily adopt and maintain this testing framework, making it both scalable 
 and efficient for our development needs.


## Back-end (Dilean)

### Testing Plan
 
Plan: Test-drive Development

For the testing plan, I will be implementing a test-driven development (TDD) approach.
 This involves creating tests for the API endpoints before writing their actual implementations.
  These tests will be based on our project requirements and minimum viable specifications (MVS), 
  ensuring they align with the agreed-upon format established by the team. 
  This process will not only guide our API developers during implementation but also help ensure that 
  we maintain high standards of quality and consistency throughout the development lifecycle.

### Testing Framework

Framework: Unit Testing - pyTest

For my testing framework, I have selected pytest, as it is the officially recommended library for testing 
Flask applications, as noted on the Flask website and supported by a wealth of resources. 
Pytest is not only easy to set up and use, but it also offers powerful features such as fixtures and a rich plugin ecosystem,
 making it an excellent choice for ensuring efficient testing of our application.
