## Lessons learned
Mr Irlbeck represents Riverside Research w/ government as their main customer. 
They are a DoD contractor. 

They implement a 4 stage mission (Steps 2-4 are cyclic):
1. design thinking - empathize, define, ideate  
2. rapid prototyping - measure, build, learn  
3. agile development - product backlog, sprint planning, sprint execution, shippable increment, sprint review     
4. sustainment - deliver, security and integration test, deploy, sustain  

Agile is an adjective (not a Noun) meant to empower software devs to have and control the how things are done

Rapid development requires a lot of feedback from users. They spend as much time getting feedback as they do developing.

Get something working fast. It may be wrong, but you'll know that quickly and can adjust versus spending weeks/months working on a product only to find out it doesn't meet the users expected outcomes. 

He mentioned that in Dayton, customers have money but not time, so they want products sooner. 

We noticed he said he didn't like SCRUM, but the Dayton Freight presenters did.
